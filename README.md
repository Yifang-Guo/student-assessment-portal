**Detailed Functions**

We have three major roles in this system, i.e., Students, Teachers, and Admins.

Admin

Admins will have a dashboard where they have the option to:
  a. Create new users (students or teachers) and set all relevant information e.g, username, password, name, phone etc.
  b. Create new courses and set all relevant information e.g, course ID, course name, semester etc

Student
1. Students will have the option to log in to the system using their username and password.
2. On successful login, students will see the courses the are enrolled in. If the student is not enrolled in any course, there should be an option where the student can see a list of all available courses and register for a particular course.
3. After successful enrollment, when the students click on a course, they should be able to see their assessment marks, in each activity marked by the instructor in that course.

Teacher
1. Teachers will have the option to log in to the system using their username and password.
2. On successful login, teachers will see the list of assigned courses. If no course is assigned, there should be an option where they can see a list of all available courses and register to teach a particular course.
3. When the teacher selects a course, the system displays a list of students enrolled in that course.
4. When the teacher selects a student, the system allows to enter marks for assessments for the selected student and in the selected course
  â€¢ There should be three assessments: 1 quiz, 1 assignment, and 1 final exam.
